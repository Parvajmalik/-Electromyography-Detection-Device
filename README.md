# Electromyography-Detection-Device
This device detects muscle electrical activity using surface electrodes and processes the signals to evaluate muscle strength, activation, and health. The analog EMG signals are amplified, filtered, digitized using the ADS1115 ADC, and then processed by an ESP32 microcontroller.

Processed data is transmitted wirelessly or via serial and visualized using MATLAB, enabling advanced signal analysis and real-time plotting.
