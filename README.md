# Electromyography-Detection-Device
This device detects muscle electrical activity using surface electrodes and processes the signals to evaluate muscle strength, activation, and health. The analog EMG signals are amplified, filtered, digitized using the ADS1115 ADC, and then processed by an ESP32 microcontroller.

Processed data is transmitted wirelessly or via serial and visualized using MATLAB, enabling advanced signal analysis and real-time plotting.
## Technologies Used:
EMG Electrodes + Signal Conditioning Circuitry (amplification, band-pass filtering)

ADS1115 External ADC – 16-bit precision for analog-to-digital conversion

ESP32 – for processing and wireless communication (WiFi/Bluetooth)

Function Generator – for signal simulation and testing

Oscilloscope – for analog waveform validation

MATLAB – for Real-time data plotting via serial communication, Muscle activity classification or pattern recognition.
